# SoccerBlog

Hello! This is my Soccer Blog. In an effort to learn how to persistenly store information on websites, I put this web app together (half way through Udemy.com's web development course) using Node.JS for the backend, Express.JS to help with the server / routing, Bootstrap for the styling, EJS for the handy use of partials & Mongoose to interface with a Mongo DB database.
